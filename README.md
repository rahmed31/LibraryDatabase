# Library Database - Overview
This repository contains code to build and administer a database reminiscient of those used by modern-day library systems. Moreover, the code present
also allows for querying and writing records from and into the database.   

# Entity Relationship Diagram
In order to build the database using MySQL Workbench, we must first design its structure using Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. I define the following structure:

![ER Diagram](lib/ER-Diagram.png?raw=true "ER Diagram")

# Creating the Relational Schema
We must now convert the ER diagram into a working Relational Model in order to build a functional database:

![Relational Schema](lib/Relational-Schema.png?raw=true "Relational Schema")
